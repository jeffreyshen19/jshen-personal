          p Hey, I'm Jeffrey, a student, technologist, and interdisciplinary researcher. My work uses software development, machine learning, data visualization, cartography, and writing to clarify and expose the sociopolitical impacts of technology, with a particular focus on cities, media, and carceral technologies.

            | I recently graduated from MIT with a degree in computer science and minor in political science, and am currently a full-stack web development intern at the U.S. Census Bureau. This fall, I will begin my Masters in Engineering in the MIT Digital Humanities Lab and the Human Dynamics Group in the MIT Media Lab. On campus, I also help run a <a href = "https://bit.ly/readingforrevolution">reading group</a> focused on understanding contemporary social issues, and spend a lot of my time thinking, talking, and (hopefully) writing about politics, history, and mass culture.
