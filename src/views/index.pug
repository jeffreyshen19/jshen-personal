          p Hey, I'm Jeffrey, a junior studying computer science and politics at MIT. I'm interested in technology and systems of power, and have done work around surveillance/carceral technologies, digital censorship/propaganda, civic technology, and data visualization.

            | Currently, I do computational social science research in the MIT Media Lab's Human Dynamics Group, and recently submitted a preprint about how Amazon's Ring Neighbors surveillance platform is used nationally and in Los Angeles. Previously, I was a data analytics intern at MassHealth, where I worked on improving data quality, visualizations, and addressing health inequities. I also was a 2020-2021 Human Rights & Technology Fellow at the MIT Center for International Studies, where I studied acoustic gunshot detection systems.

              p Used spatial regression modeling and computational grounded theory to study how Amazon's Ring Neighbors platform is used nationally and, as a case study, in Los Angeles. Our paper was submitted to CSCW 2022, with a <a href = "assets/ring-cscw-2021.pdf">preprint available</a>. Research was conducted in the MIT Media Lab's Human Dynamics group, with Dan Calacci and Alex (Sandy) Pentland.
